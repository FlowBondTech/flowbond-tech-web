                $DANZ is a utility and rewards token designed to power a movement-based economy. It lives at the intersection of dance culture, Web3 technology, and biometric flow states. Through the FlowBond wearable and ecosystem, every dance session, group sync, and flow activation generates real, measurable value — and $DANZ is how that value is distributed.

                $DANZ is more than a token — it's a cultural catalyst for regenerative joy and embodied connection. As the FlowBond network grows, $DANZ will become the energetic fuel for a new kind of decentralized movement economy — one where those who move the most, feel the most, and connect the most are the ones who thrive.
